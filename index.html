      <h1>THE BASICS OF HTML- A SIMPLE GUIDE</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to my first website. Everything you want to know about the
        basics of HTML is in this website.
      </p>
      <h2>INTRODUCTION TO HTML</h2>
      <p>
        I'll do a brief introduction to HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML
        stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard language used
        to create and structure content on the web. Everything you see on web
        pages—text, images, links, forms—is written using HTML. An HTML document
        contains content that web browsers read and display. With HTML, we can
        add everything displayed on a website. HTML is the skeleton of a
        website—the building blocks of web pages. HTML is the foundation of
        every webpage. Without HTML, web pages wouldn't exist, even when using
        modern tools and platforms. HTML is always working in the background.
        HTML is not a programming language but a
        <strong>Markup Language</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>KEY FEATURES OF HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Structure:</strong> HTML organizes content into headings,
          paragraphs, lists, and sections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Links:</strong> It connects paages together using hyperlinks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Media:</strong> It allows you to add image, videos, and audio
          to web pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Forms:</strong> It helps create input fields, buttons, and
          interactive features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simple and Universal:</strong> Every browser understands HTML.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>UNDERSTANDING THE NAME</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Hypertext: </strong>Refers to text that links to other text or
          web pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Markup:</strong> Means that HTML uses tags to "mark up" or
          define the different parts of a document.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Language:</strong> It's a standardized set of rules that
          browsers understand.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>WHAT HTML IS NOT</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          HTML is not a programming language. It doesn't have logic like "if" or
          "loop".
        </li>
        <li>
          It doesn't make things pretty on its own, that's what CSS is for.
        </li>
        <li>
          It doesn't make things interactive, that's what javascript is for.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH HTML?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure content</strong> on a web page</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organize text</strong> into headings, paragraphs, and lists
        </li>
        <li><strong>Build simple websites</strong> or webpages</li>
        <li>Create a digital resume or portfolio website</li>
        <li><strong>Write structured online articles</strong> or tutorials</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lay the foundation</strong> before styling or adding
          interactions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Basic tags in HTML</h2>
      <p>
        Basic tags in HTML include the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for a new
        heading, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> for a new paragraph,<code
          >&lt;br&gt;</code
        >
        to add a line break, the <code>&lt;nbsp&gt;</code> entity to add a
        non-breaking space.<br />
        There are two types of lists in HTML: the unordered list
        (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) and the ordered list
        (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>).<br />
        The unordered list is added with
        <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>).<br />
        while the ordered list is added with
        <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>).<br />
        The items listed are added with <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
      </p>

      <h3>LISTING IN HTML</h3>
      <p>
        I'll give some examples of ordered items and unordered items, so let's
        start with unordered items.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Orange</li>
      </ul>
      Now, let's look at ordered items.
      <ol>
        <li>First</li>
        <li>Second</li>
        <li>Third</li>
      </ol>

      <!--This is the start of html code for the second section, and we'll start each section with a header tag -->

      <h3>Unordered items</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>DVD</li>
        <li>CD</li>
        <li>Blu Ray</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Ordered item list</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>DVD</li>
        <li>CD</li>
        <li>Blu RAY</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The difference between the UNORDERED LIST AND THE ORDERED LIST can be
        seen,<br />
        Ordered lists display items with numbers, while unordered lists use
        bullet points.
      </p>

      <p>TABLES ARE ALSO MADE WITH HTML We are going to make a table here</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>THE PLANETS</th>
          <th>THE OCEANS</th>
          <th>THE DESERTS</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>The earth</td>
          <td>Pacific</td>
          <td>Sahara</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pluto</td>
          <td>atlantic</td>
          <td>Gobi</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        Next we are going to be creating a web link, please click on the link

      <p>
        <strong>
          N.B. Just missing one letter can ruin your html,<br />
          and you won't get the result you desire in your web page</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        on sizing and resizing images, <br />
        all you have to do is add your desired or preferred width and height
        attributes to the image tag, using pixels (e.g., width="200px") or
        percentages (e.g., width="50%") for more control. For example:
        <code>&lt;img src="..." width="200px" height="150px" /&gt;</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        we are going to be talking about nested elements briefly. Nested
        elements are elements inside another elements. The only element that is
        not inside another element is the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element,
        which is called the root element. The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> are nested elements, both inside the
        <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>. We'll call the body the parent nested element
        and then call the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element the child of the
        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. It's always good to put the starting
        and closing tag inside the parent element; putting the closing tag
        outside the body element is a misnested element and it will start to
        cause a lot of problems. Always keep the parent and child elements
        properly nested inside the body to maintain correct nesting.
      </p>
      <form action="method" id="theform">
        <div class="row">
          <label for="firstname">First Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="firstname" /> <br />
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <label for="lastname">Last Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="lastname" /> <br />
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <label for="Middlename">Middle Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="Middlename" />
        </div>
      </form>
      <p>
        That was a one (single) line text box,the form element acts as a
        container to put in whatever input field we want, if you want it a lot
        wider all you have to do is the add the desirable size you want, you can
        add a label to indicate what its for, so people will know the
        information they are entering,with label information can be collected
        from user's which will be connected to our server where we will process
        the data. we are going to be looking at a multi line text box next, in
        the single line text box we used the input element tag But in this
        multi-line text box we are going to use the text area element tag. if
        you want to increase the size all you have to do is to add rows and cols
        and add the size.
      </p>
      <form action="method" id="theform">
        comment: <br />
        <textarea rows="10" cols="40" name="Comments" id="Comments:"></textarea>
        <br />
        <input type="button" value="submit" />
      </form>
      <p>
        if you want a submit button where the user can click, over here we get
        to use the input element tag again,<br />
        We going to add a radio buutton <br />in a radio button you get to
        choose one option. <br />in inputing the radio button we still have to
        use the input tag with the type as radio,
      </p>
      <form action="method" id="theform">
        yes:
        <input type="radio" name="yesorno" id="" /> <br />
        No:
        <input type="radio" name="yesorno" id="" /> <br />
        <input type="button" value="submit" />
      </form>
      <p>
        next we are going to be looking at the check box. <br />
        the input tag is also used in inputing the checkbox where you get to
        pick mutiple choice, <br />
        we use the input tag with the type as checkbox, <br />
        if you want one of the options to always be checked all you have to do
        is to use the checked attribute. <br />
        The user can always deselct this at anytime but whenever the page shows
        it as already been checked.
      </p>
      <form action="method" id="theform">
        <input type="checkbox" name="" checked="checked" />Football<br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="" />Basketball <br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="" />Hockey <br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="" />Baseball <br />
        <input type="button" value="submit " />
      </form>
      <p>
        the difference between checkbox and radio is in checkbox you get to
        select more than one options <br />but in radio you get to choose just
        one option. <br />
        Next we are going to go over the number input element,<br />once again
        we are going to be using the input element but this time with the type
        as number, here is an example, <br />
        in this web control box it only allow users to input numbers no
        characters or letters just numbers, <br />
        so what if you want a minimum and a maximum amount of number? <br />
        yeah thats where our minimum and maximun attribute come to use, <br />
        i'll give an example of that too
      </p>
      <form action="method" id="theform">
        <div class="row"><input type="number" /><br /></div>
        <div class="row"><input type="number" min="1" max="50" /> <br /></div>
        <div class="row"><input type="button" value="submit" /></div>
      </form>
      <p>
        next we are going to go over how to set up a drop down list in HTML,
        this is different from a checkbox we did a while ago,<br />
        a checkbox allow the user to select as many option as the want but a
        drop down-list allow the user to select one option, <br />it is the
        select element that we use to create the drop down list we use an
        opening tag and a closing tag <br />
        and we use the option element imbedded inside the select element, <br />
        here are examples
      </p>
      <form action="method" id="theform">
        <select name="" id="">
          <option value="London">London</option>
          <option value="Manchester">Manchester</option>
          <option value="England">England</option>
          <br />
          <input type="button" value="submit" />
        </select>
      </form>
      <p>
        Next we'll be seting up the date and time box, this highlights the date
        and enable the user input a date and the number of days they want,
        <br />
        a minimum and maximum amount of days can also be set
      </p>
      <form action="method" id="theform">
        Enter a day you want to travel to America:
        <div class="row"><input type="date" name="Day" id="Day" /> <br /></div>
        Number of days:
        <div class="row">
          <input
            type="date"
            name="NumDays"
            id="NumDays"
            min="1"
            max="10"
          /><br />
        </div>
        <div class="row"><input type="button" value="submit" /></div>
      </form>
      <p>
        we are going to look at other things we can do with the Form element,
        <br />
        and one of it is the Feildbox and legend element, the field form add
        some nice styling to you form
      </p>
      <form action="method" id="theform">
        <fieldset>
          <legend>Enter a day you want to travel to America:</legend>
          <div class="row">
            <input type="date" name="Day" id="Day" /> <br />
          </div>
          Number of days:
          <div class="row">
            <input
              type="date"
              name="NumDays"
              id="NumDays"
              min="1"
              max="10"
            /><br /><br />
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            Name: <input type="text" /> <br /><input
              type="button"
              value="submit"
            />
          </div>
        </fieldset>
      </form>
      <p>
        we are going to take a break from coding and talk about HTML again, so
        we'll be looking at attributes in HTML, as we know elements are made of
        of tags an openig tag and a closing tag, and the elements tell the
        browser something about the information in-between two tags, the
        paragraph element tells the browser there is a text there, and the
        heading element tells the browser there is a heading there, the body
        will tell the browser everything is inside the body and the body will
        make up the actual web page, what an attribute does is to give more
        information about a particular element, attributes are always in the
        opening tags inside the angles brackets, attributes always have three
        items, first is the attribute name then the equal sign and then the
        value,
        <strong
          >some attribute only go with a particular element the "for" attribute
          is only available for the label element, you wouldn't put that in a
          paragragh element, in some attribute you can put in almost every
          element, and other attributes are very specific to a specific type of
          element
        </strong>
        next we are going to talk about escape characters, examples of escape
        characters include the space character, the trademark character (TM),
        the copyright character, &nbsp; &#8482; that was the trademark
        character, &copy; the copyright character, &gt; the greater than
        character, &lt; the lesser than character, &quest; the question
        character. Next we are going to discuss the bold element, the strong
        element,the strong and bold element looks same. But with the strong
        element you can place emphasis on certain words and it is used also for
        text to speech programs, the italic element and the EM element, the
        italic and the em element looks same. But the em element also add
        emphasis to certain words and can be used on text to speech programs
      </p>

      <p>This is a <b>bold element</b></p>
      <p>This is a <strong>strong element</strong></p>
      <p>this is an <i>italic element</i></p>
      <p>This is an<em> EM element</em></p>
      <p>
        We are going to look at iframes in html, iframe is another html document
        that we could imbed into our existing web page, <br />and we can do that
        with the iframe element, it can be use to insert content from other
        pages, <br />
        <iframe
          src="first"
          id="ouriframe"
          frameborder="1"
          width="200"
          height="200"
        >
        </iframe>
        <a href="second" target="ouriframe">switch to new document</a> <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll look at the sup and sub elements, the sup element stands for
        superscript andF the sub element stands for subscript,<br />
        the sup element allows you to display text above the main body of the
        text, <br />
        while subscript allows you to display the text below the main text,
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of superscript,
        <b>Destiny encounter was july 25<sup>th</sup></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of subscript,
        <b>There's plenty of H<sub>2</sub>O in the lake</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are going to deal with the title and alt attributes, <br />the title
        attribute allow you get a title when you hover over an image, I'll give
        an example of it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img
        src="images/Pictures/image.jpg.g.jpg"
        title="pink living room aesthetics"
        class="img"
      />
      <br />
      <p>
        That was for the title attribute the alt attribute stands for alternate
        text for an image, what it really allows is incase we can't display an
        image for a reason, like if we have the wrong path or the image is no
        longer there you can display alternate text so that at least something
        is displayed. Here's an example:

        <img
          src="images/Pictures/image.jpg.g.jpg i"
          title="pink living room aesthetics"
          alt="image.jpg.g.jpg"
        />
        <br />
        That's a perfect example, when you hover the image the title appears,
        and if the image path is broken, the alternate text ("image.jpg.g.jpg")
        will be displayed instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The audio element tag, in adding an audio to your web page you have to
        use the audio element tag, <br />
        the audio control attribute and add your source <br />
      </p>
      <audio controls>
        <source src=" There's no shadow you won't light up.mp3 " />
      </audio>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you want the file to automatically play in the web for that we have
        to use the autoplay attribute, and if you want it to loop you have to
        use the loop attribute so it will loop over and over,<br />
        lets try it <br />
        <audio controls autopla loop>
          <source src="There's no shadow you won't light up.mp3" />
        </audio>
      </p>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="There's no shadow you won't light up.mp3" />
      </audio>
      <br />
      <p>
        And then we have the drag attribute, this allows you to drag in the web
        browser and it can be used anywhere in the webpages, the draggable, and
        then we have the video element, its what we use to add videos to our web
        pages, <br />
      </p>
      <div class="video-wrapper">
        <video video controls><source src="so.mp4" /></video>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        We are going to talk about the DOCTYPE declaration we've been putting
        before our HTML code. The DOCTYPE is the very first thing that we put in
        our HTML document, and it always comes before the HTML tag. It is
        important to note that the DOCTYPE is not an HTML tag; it is an
        instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page needs
        to use. put in our HTML document, and it always come before the HTML
        tag, it is important that the DOCTYPE is not an HTML tag it is an

      <h1>INTRODUCTION TO CSS</h1>
      <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used
        to describe the appearance and formatting of a document written in HTML.
        CSS adds style to your web pages, allowing you to change colors, fonts,
        spacing, and layout without altering the HTML structure. Think of HTML
        as the structure (like building a fence), and CSS as the paint that
        makes it look attractive. CSS rules are placed inside the style element,
        usually within the head section of your HTML document. In CSS, styles
        are defined using properties (like color, font-size, background) and
        values (like green, 16px, #fff). The semicolon (;) separates each
        property-value pair, and px stands for pixels, a common unit for sizing.
        To style headers, you can use properties like background-color and
        border-bottom. CSS inheritance means that styles applied to parent
        elements (like body) are inherited by child elements, unless overridden
        by more specific rules. Classes are used to style individual elements,
        and you can override inherited styles by targeting specific elements or
        classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS stands for <span class="highlights"> Cascading style sheets</span>.
        It is used to style and layout web pages, for example to change the
        color of text, align items, create spacing,and make your web responsive
        on different devices. CSS is a language that describes how the HTML
        elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
      </p>

      <h2>Why do we need CSS?</h2>

      <p>
        Without CSS, every website would look like plain, unstyled text, like a
        word document. CSS allows you to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change fonts and colors</li>
        <li>Add spacing and borders</li>
        <li>Position elements</li>
        <li>Make responsive designs for mobile devices</li>
        <li>Add animations and transitions</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Basic CSS structures</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS is written using rules called declarations.</li>
        <li>
          Each rule targets an HTML eement (called a selector) and applies
          styles to it.
        </li>
        <li>A property is what is being changed (like color or font size).</li>
        <li>
          A value is the setting you apply to that property (like red or 16px).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Three ways to Use CSS</h1>
      <p>There are three ways to use CSS and they are;</p>
      <p class="black underline"><strong> 1. Inline CSS</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Style is written directly inside an HTML tag.</li>
        <li>It is used for quick, one-time changes.</li>
        <li>Not recommended for large projects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="black underline"><strong> 2. Internal CSS</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          style rules are written inside a style tag in the HTML head section
        </li>
        <li>
          Useful for small websites or when you don't want to create a seperate
          file.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="black underline"><strong> 3. External CSS </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Styles are written in seperate css file.</li>
        <li>This file is linked to the HTML.</li>
        <li>Best practice for large websites.</li>
        <li>Keeps content (HTML) and designs (CSS) seperate.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Common CSS properties</h2>
      &nbsp;
      <p>There are various css properties some are;</p>

      <h2>What Does "Cascading" Mean?</h2>
      <p class="para2">
        CSS follows a hierarchy where some rules take priority over others. The
        order of importance (from highest to lowest)
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Inline styles</li>
        <li>Internal styles (in the head section)</li>
        <li>External styles (linked CSS file)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        More specific rules override general ones. The last rule written will
        override earlier ones if they conflict.
      </p>
      <h2>BASICS OF CSS</h2>
      <p class="para2">
        classes can be applied to as many different element as possible, you
        just have to remove the individual elements in front of it, if you just
        put a dot and the class it will apply to the element, you can asls apply
        multiple classes to an element, we do that by adding a class name right
        pass our existing class name, the font font-family property allows us to
        control display on the browser,the font-weight properties allows you to
        control the thickness of your font, so far we have been looking at
        internal style sheet next we'll look at external style sheet. You
        specify an id in css by using the hash symbol, the id attributeis for a
        specific set of css code you want to apply for a specific element.
      </p>
      <h2>The ID Attribute In CSS</h2>
      &nbsp;

      <h2>What Is An ID?</h2>
      &nbsp;
      <ul>
        <li>An ID is a unique identifier assigned to an HTML element.</li>
        <li>It helps to identify one specific element on a webpage.</li>
        <li>
          An ID must be unique within a page no two elements should have the
          same ID.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Purpose of the ID attribute</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Used to apply styles to a specific element.</li>
        <li>Used to target an element for javascript or link anchors.</li>
        <li>
          Helps with navigation and scripting by providing a unique reference.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How CSS uses IDs</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          In CSS, you use the ID selector to target an element with a specific
          ID.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ID selector is marked by a hash symbol (#) followed by th ID name.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because IDs are unique, styles applied to an ID only affect that one
          element.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Example Uses Of IDs</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Styling a single button differently from others.</li>
        <li>Highlighting a specific section or heading.</li>
        <li>Linkink directly to a part of the page via an anchor link.</li>
        <li>Using javascript to manupulate that element specifically.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Important Points About IDs</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Each ID value should be unique on a webpage, use IDs carefully.</li>
        <li>
          IDs have higher specificity than class selectors, so they override
          class styles when both apply.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to style multiple elements the same way, use classes
          instead of IDs
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The div element stands for division. It is a block-level container used
        to group HTML elements, it has no default styling used for structure, it
        is often styled with CSS classes or IDs, commonly used for page
        sections, layouts, and grouping content. The span element is an inline
        element used to group inline elements and apply styles without breaking
        the flow of text.
      </p>
      <h3>More interesting links</h3>
      <a href="contact.html">CSS for beginners (external css)</a> <br />
      <a href="inline.html">CSS for beginners (inline CSS)</a>
      <p>
        I added this links using the anchor tag. add content page by creating
        new HTML files and linking the same CSS to reuse styles with classes.
        and reusing CSS classes lets you apply the same style to multiple
        elements, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain. You can add
        special effects using pseudo-classes like <code>:hover</code> to create
        interactive effects when users move their mouse over elements. For
        example, you can change the color of a button or link when hovered.
        Block elements (like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) always start on a new line and take up the full
        width available, while inline elements (like <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>) stay in the flow of
        text and only take up as much width as needed.

        <strong>Positioning Elements in CSS</strong>: CSS allows you to control
        how elements are positioned on the page using properties like
        <code>position</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>,
        <code>right</code>, and <code>bottom</code>. The most common position
        values are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>static</strong> (default): Elements are positioned according
          to the normal flow of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>relative</strong>: Elements are positioned relative to their
          normal position.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>absolute</strong>: Elements are positioned relative to the
          nearest positioned ancestor (not static).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>fixed</strong>: Elements are positioned relative to the
          browser window and stay in place when scrolling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>sticky</strong>: Elements toggle between relative and fixed,
          depending on the scroll position.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="position: relative">
        <strong>Floating Elements</strong>: The <code>float</code> property
        allows elements (like images or boxes) to "float" to the left or right
        of their container, letting text and inline elements wrap around them.

        <strong>Example:</strong> <br />

        <img
          src="images/b.a.jpg"
          style="position: right; top: 0; width: 150px"
          &lt;=" This text will wrap around the floated image."
          title="A floating image"
        />
      </div>
      <br />

      <p>
        <strong>Absolute Positioning</strong>: When you use position: absolute;,
        the element is removed from the normal flow and placed exactly where you
        specify using top, left,right, or bottom. fixed position for an element.
        <br />
        <strong>Overflow Property</strong>: The overflow property controls what
        happens when content overflows an element's box (e.g., scroll, hidden,
        auto, visible). <br />
        <strong>Cursor Property</strong>: The cursor property lets you control
        the type of mouse pointer shown when hovering over an element. For
        example, you can use <code>cursor: pointer;</code> to show a hand icon
        for clickable items like buttons or links. cursor property values
        include <strong>:</strong> default, pointer, text, move, inherit,
        crosshair, not-allowed, Auto, URL, Help, hand, progress , wait, grab and
        more. custom cursor.

      <p>
        Relative positioning in CSS allows you to move an element relative to
        its normal position in the document flow. You can use properties like
        <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and
        <code>bottom</code> to adjust its placement. The space originally
        reserved for the element remains, so other elements are not affected.
        Relative position is determined by the first static element. Absolute
        position is determined by the first non static element.

        The inline-block display value, lets an element behave like an inline
        element (sits in line with text or other elements) while also keeping
        the ability of a block element (can have width, height, margin,
        paddding). It's useful for placing elements side by side while still
        controlling their size and spacing.

        To create a perfect triangle, you can use CSS borders. Set the width and

      <h3>Review and descendant selectors</h3>
      <p>
        selectors are very important in CSS, they are fundamental. The "type
        selector" selects elements based on their type (e.g., div, p), The ID
        selector selects an element based on its unique ID (e.g., #header
        selects the element with id="header") its select element with (#). The
        class selector select element with (.class). we can also combine
        selectors using combined selectors, we use a comma to seperate when we
        use multiple selectors. While the descendant selector selects elements
        that are nested within a specific parent element (e.g., div p selects
        all p elements inside a div), The child selector selects elements that
        are direct children of a specific parent element (e.g., div > p).
      </p>
      <p>
        The sibling selector, the sibling selectors select elements that share
        the same parent element. For example, div > p selects all p elements
        that are direct children of a div element.
      </p>

        <h3>Typical CSS selectors include:</h3>
        <p>
          Types of selectors include: sibling selectors, child selectors, and
          descendant selectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The general sibling selector (e.g., div ~ p) selects all p elements
          that are siblings of a div element, regardless of their position in
          the hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          #1 The adjacent sibling selector (e.g., div + p) selects the first p
          element that is immediately following a div element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The child combinator (e.g., div > p) selects all p elements that are
          direct children of a div element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nth child selector (e.g., div:nth-child(n)) selects the nth child
          of a parent element.
        </p>
        <div id="rightp">
          <p>some text</p>
          <p>more text</p>
          <p>even more text</p>
          <p>some text</p>
          <p>some more text</p>

      <h2>Strategies for Using CSS Selectors Effectively</h2>
      <p>strategies for using CSS selectors effectively:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Be specific: Use more specific selectors to target elements precisely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid over-qualification: Don't use overly complex selectors when
          simpler ones will do.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use classes and IDs: Prefer classes and IDs over element selectors for
          better performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep it simple: Write clear and concise selectors for better
          readability.
        </li>
      </ul>
