    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO HTML</h1>
    <p>
      I'll do a brief introduction to HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML
      stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard language used to
      create and structure content on the web. Everything you see on web pages,
      text, images, links, forms is written using HTML. An HTML document
      contains content that web browsers read and display. With HTML, we can add
      everything displayed on a website. HTML is the skeleton of a website the
      building blocks of web pages. HTML is the foundation of every webpage.
      Without HTML, web pages wouldn't exist, even when using modern tools and
      platforms. HTML is always working in the background. HTML is not a
      programming language but a
      <strong>Markup Language</strong>.
