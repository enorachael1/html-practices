    <h2>WHAT HTML IS NOT</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        HTML is not a programming language. It doesn't have logic like "if" or
        "loop".
      </li>
      <li>It doesn't make things pretty on its own, that's what CSS is for.</li>
      <li>
        It doesn't make things interactive, that's what javascript is for.
      </li>
    </ul>
